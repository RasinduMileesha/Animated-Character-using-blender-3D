<h2>Initially I used blender software for the creation of animated character. In the object mode I have created my character from a UV sphere for the head and then continued for the development by using the mirror modifier. I have grown shapes forward by choosing faces and then by pressing E for easy modeling. I completed the object creation within 1-5 days.</h2>
<h2>After creating the body, I enabled clothing from edit mode by pressing C to highlight the area that I needed to make the clothing and then pressed shift + D to copy he object data. And then pressed P to separate the selection. Importantly I have used modifiers like “Solidity, subdivision surface” to smooth the material</h2>
<h2>Then I used armature for the created body by adding armature to all the body parts that need to be rigged.</h2>
<h2>Then I have created the environment that created animated character is going to deploy. I have added a plane and modified it with grass texture and changed its physics to look real. Then I created a tree by using sapling tree gen addon in blender. Then after that I used a cube to change its physical shape into a rock by using the modifier subdivision surface. More importantly I have used two suns to balance the lightning effects.</h2>
<h2>After completing the major parts of the development of 3D character and next to that I have completed the animation part. At first, I selected armature and object body and pressed ctrl + p to transform all then it integrated together after that I generated a rig. By using pose mode, I have made the movements precisely accordingly to the time frames and saved it all for the final animation.
And then by choosing correct key frames I adjusted the rigging of the character step by step and finally created an animation for 130 frames.</h2>
